Things2THL

Conversion program to transfer all tasks from Things
(http://culturedcode.com/things/ ) to The Hit List
(http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/ ).

To see a usage message:

./bin/things2thl -h

WARNING:
--------

Use if you want, but a lot of functionality is still missing,
including:

- For now all tasks/projects are lumped together, regardless of which
  view they came from in Things.

  Plan: Put tasks into Inbox, Today, Scheduled, Someday, Trash, etc.

- Handling contexts vs tags

  Plan: make it a user option which Things tasks should be considered
  as contexts.

- Handling completed projects

  Plan: put them in a different folder/list, user-definable option

- Handling project tags

  Plan: propagate them to individual tasks if --projects-as-lists is
  	used, otherwise leave them in the project task.

- Handle rich-text notes (with attachments, links, etc.) properly

  Plan: not sure yet. Need to investigate how notes are stored in
  THL (Things uses an XML format)


Known issues:
-------------

- Cancellation/completion dates are not transferred, because THL
  handles those attributes as read-only. So if you choose to transfer
  completed/canceled tasks, they will all appear in your "completed
  today" view.


INSTALL:
--------

You need to install rb-appscript from
http://appscript.sourceforge.net/rb-appscript/install.html
