Things2THL

Conversion program to transfer all tasks from Things
(http://culturedcode.com/things/ ) to The Hit List
(http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/ ).

Written by Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

INSTALL:
--------

You need Things 1.1.1 or later, since things2thl requires Applescript
support.

You need to install rb-appscript from
http://appscript.sourceforge.net/rb-appscript/install.html

Run things2thl by changing into the base directory of this
distribution and running:
	     ./bin/things2thl [options]


USAGE:
-----

To see a usage message:

   ./bin/things2thl -h



Functionality still missing:
---------------------------

- Handling contexts vs tags

  Plan: make it a user option which Things tasks should be considered
  as contexts.

- Handle rich-text notes (with attachments, links, etc.) properly

  Plan: not sure yet. Need to investigate how notes are stored in
  THL (Things uses an XML format)

- Handling delegation ("People" feature in Things)

  Not sure how to transfer this to THL. Ideas are welcome.

Known issues:
-------------

- Cancellation/completion dates are not transferred, because THL
  handles those attributes as read-only. So if you choose to transfer
  completed/canceled tasks, they will all appear in your "completed
  today" view.

- Tasks in the Things "Scheduled" focus are transferred, but the
  scheduling itself is not transferred, because this information is
  not accessible through AS from either Things not THL.
