	* README: Fixed README for new options.

2009-05-25  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* VERSION: Version bump to 0.8.1

2009-05-25  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* README, things2thl.gemspec: Regenerated gemspec for version 0.8.0

2009-05-25  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* ChangeLog, VERSION: Version bump to 0.8.0

2009-05-25  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added new mode of operation
	--inbox (-I) to transfer only tasks from the Inbox.

2009-05-25  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added printing of some
	statistics at the end - number of items created, total time elapsed.
	Can be disabled by specifying -q twice (-qq).

2009-05-25  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added option --sync, which
	causes items (areas, projects and tasks) not to be created if they
	already exist. This is useful if you add more items to Things after
	you have transferred to THL, and want to re-transfer just the new
	ones.  This option is disabled by default because the duplicate checking is
	done using only the item's name, so if you have multiple entries
	with the same name in Things, they will only be transferred once
	with --sync enabled.

2009-05-24  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added options --areas-as-tags
	and --areas-as-contexts, which specify that areas in Things should
	be transferred to THL as tags/contexts respectively, instead of
	created as separate entities.  Thanks to @biomac101 for the suggestion.

2009-05-21  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* things2thl.gemspec: Regenerated gemspec for version 0.7.0

2009-05-21  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* ChangeLog, VERSION, lib/Things2THL.rb: Version bump to 0.7.0

2009-05-21  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* README, bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added a new mode of
	operation --projects-areas-as-lists (-B). As the name implies, in
	this mode both projects and areas from Things are stored as lists in
	THL. This means that projects are NOT nested inside areas, as is the
	case in the other two modes. Instead, the lists for areas will
	contain only single tasks that were inside the area in Things.  If --projects-top-level and --areas-top-level are not given, all the
	lists will be created in the main folders group. Otherwise, they
	will appear within the corresponding folder.

2009-05-21  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added --areas-top-level option
	to specify a folder in which imported Areas should be created.

2009-05-20  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* README: Updated README

2009-05-20  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* things2thl.gemspec: Regenerated gemspec for version 0.6.0

2009-05-20  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* ChangeLog, VERSION, lib/Things2THL.rb: Version bump to 0.6.0

2009-05-20  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* Rakefile, lib/Things2THL.rb: Vastly improved conversion of the
	notes field. The HTML stored in the Things notes is parsed and
	rendered as text, including all the appropriate URLs and links. It
	does not look exactly as the original, but is quite usable.

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* README: Updated to state limitation of transferring repeating
	tasks.

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: Make Scheduled and Logbook a list instead of a
	folder when --projects-as-tasks. Someday stays always as a folder,
	because it can contain areas (suspended areas)

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: Transfer activation_date as start_date so that
	scheduled (one-time) tasks are set appropriately. Still need to
	figure out how to identify repeating tasks.

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* things2thl.gemspec: Regenerated gemspec for version 0.5.0

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* ChangeLog, README, VERSION, lib/Things2THL.rb: Version bump to
	0.5.0

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Made it mandatory to specify
	the mode of operation (--projects-as-lists or --projects-as-tasks).

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added --[no-]time-tags option,
	which allows time-estimate tags in Things for the form Xsec/Xmin/Xhr
	(e.g. I use "10min", "30min", "60min") to be converted to the
	appropriate time estimate attribute of the tasks in THL. For now the
	format of the time-estimate tags is fixed, but I might add
	customization if I someone asks for it. This option is disabled by
	default.  Also changed the --context-tags-regex option to be
	--[no-]context-tags, which allows both specifying the regex and
	(with --no-) disabling the feature in a single option.

2009-05-19  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* things2thl.gemspec: Regenerated gemspec for version 0.4.4

	* bin/things2thl: Improved help text by showing actual options

2009-05-18  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* VERSION: Version bump to 0.3.0

2009-05-18  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added option
	--context-tags-regex (-C) for specifying which Things tags should be
	considered as contexts when moving to THL. By default its value is
	"^@", which means any tag starting with @ will be entered into THL
	as a context. Any regular expression can be used.  If any of the
	tags matched by this regex contains spaces, the spaces will be
	converted to underscores, since THL does not allow spaces in context
	names.

2009-05-18  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl: Code cleanup.

2009-05-18  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: Added value caching for ThingsNode, drastically
	reducing the number of Apple events that have to be generated

2009-05-18  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: Eliminated unnecessary (and extremely frequent)
	redefinition of ThingsNode methods, which made the script much
	slower by invoking eval_class thousands of times.

2009-05-17  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* Manifest, Rakefile, things2thl.gemspec: Added Rakefile, Manifest
	and gemspec file

2009-05-17  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: Added cache of focusnames, and avoid computing
	the task cache for "Logbook" (which can be pretty big) unless
	--completed was specified.

2009-05-16  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* README, bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Fully functional
	version! All the essential functionality is there.  Projects, areas
	and foci are handled appropriately, as are completed tasks and
	projects, suspended areas, etc.

2009-05-14  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: - Handle project due dates when --projects-as-lists by creating a
	  new task within the list, with the appropriate due date.  - Mark fake "notes" task when --projects-as-lists as completed if   the enclosing project is completed or canceled.  - Added project- and area-tag inheritance into individual tasks   when the project/area is a list (THL lists can't have tags) - Added generic internal mechanism for creating additional nodes,
	  used both for the due dates tasks and the notes tasks.

2009-05-14  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: - Inherit project tags into the corresponding tasks - Base support for putting tasks in the proper focus. So far, only   Today tasks are properly flagged.

2009-05-13  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: Simplified postproc blocks in STRUCTURE by
	passing the Things2THL object to it, which allows calling methods in
	the object (the postproc block itself cannot access anything from
	Things2THL because it is not defined as part of the Things2THL
	class).

2009-05-13  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* lib/Things2THL.rb: Fixed bug when --projects-as-tasks was used

2009-05-13  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* README, bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: Added proper handling
	of most node attributes, including rudimentary transfering of the
	tags (not contexts vs tags yet).  Updated README with some usage notes and warnings.

2009-05-12  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* bin/things2thl, lib/Things2THL.rb: - Modified to use Applescript to get stuff out of Things instead   of the things-rb library (needs Things 1.1.1 or later) - Simplified the algorithm to a multiple-pass one (areas, projects,
	  tasks) using memoization to do the nesting, instead of trying to do
	  a hierarchical traversal.  - Tasks are also now imported, but those not in projects or areas
	  are still not divided properly (e.g. in Inbox, Scheduled, etc.)

2009-05-05  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* README: Updated URLs

2009-05-05  Diego Zamboni <diego@zzamboni.org>

	* First commit - partially-working code. Able to transfer some tasks
	from Things to THL, but not all attributes are preserved yet
